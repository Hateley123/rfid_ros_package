# Package Introduction
This package is designed to create a ros2 topic that can be used to pass information from an Impinj RFID Reader to the computer for later use. Since most of the script operates off of python to increase computation efficiency, this publication of a ros topic prevents the need of using intermediary files for data transfer.
